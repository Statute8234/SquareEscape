# About

This Python platformer game features a player character, represented by a red square, who can move horizontally using arrow keys or the "A" and "D" keys. The objective is to navigate the character across the screen while avoiding falling off platforms. The player interacts with a static platform at the bottom of the screen, which prevents the character from falling off the screen. The game mechanics include basic movement controls and a simple gravity system, allowing the character to jump and fall realistically. Gravity affects the player's movement, causing it to fall downward when not supported by a platform.

# Features

The Python platformer game features a player-controlled character, represented by a red square, who can be moved horizontally using arrow keys or the "A" and "D" keys. The primary objective is to navigate the character across the screen, avoiding falling off platforms or ledges. A static platform at the bottom prevents the character from falling off the screen entirely. Basic movement controls allow the character to traverse the game environment. The game incorporates a simple gravity system, causing the character to fall downward when not supported by a platform. This combines precise movement, gravity dynamics, and strategic navigation as players guide the red square through the challenging environment.
